Families of the deceased babies, all aged between one and five days, alleged that ventilators and the oxygen support system in the Special Newborn Care Unit stopped functioning during the power outage.  \n\nHowever the hospital officials have denied that a power failure even happened and claim it was a “power interruption” and vital life-support systems remained unaffected. \n\n“Electricity supply to the hospital had definitely stopped for some time, but the ventilator and oxygen support systems were on,” insisted Ambikapur medical college dean Dr Ramanesh Murthy. “It was not a power failure, rather it was an interruption for the maintenance work on Monday morning. As the UPS was on, there was no chance of the ventilator and oxygen support system getting shut down,” said Dr Murthy. \n\nNo information on the dead babies was revealed by the hospital who brushed aside the matter saying they were “busy with the probe”. Few other children are said to be critical and under observation. \n\nState Health Minister TS Singhdeo has ordered the health secretary to conduct a high-level inquiry by a team comprising senior officials. Singhdeo flew to Ambikapur to meet the bereaved families and take stock of the situation after learning of the incident at around 10:30 am.\n\n“I have spoken with chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and I’m visiting Ambikapur Medical College Hospital with his permission. I will talk to the doctors and relatives to find out the reason behind the deaths. Accountability will also be fixed and culprits will be punished severely if (their guilt is) established,” Singhdeo said.\n\nThe deaths were reported between 5 am and 8.30 am on Monday. Dr Murthy stressed that the babies who lost their lives were already in a critical state and there was no link between their deaths and the power interruption. \n\n“Seven nurses and a doctor were on duty and they reported the death between these hours. While two of the children weighed around 1.5 kg each because of their premature birth, two others were suffering from heart and respiratory problems even though their weight was near normal,” said Dr Murthy. \n\nHe further informed that a similar incident was reported one and a half years ago, when two-three children died. All of them were premature births and weighed 800-1200 gram."},

The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests,” on its announcement page for ChatGPT.\n\nBasically, it is based on GPT-3.5, a language model which is used for deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nThe ChatGPT is more engaging compared to the older GPT-3 model which only took text prompts and tried to continue on that with its own generated text. \n\nMoreover, this version is much better at generating detailed text and can even come up with poems. \n\nWhen it comes to its unique characteristic, it is memory. \n\nBasically, this bot can remember earlier comments in a conversation and recount them to the user.\n\nOpenAI has only opened up the bot for evaluation and beta testing now, it plans the API access most probably for next year. \n\nThis would definitely help the developers as with API access, they  will be able to implement ChatGPT into their own software.\n\nBut it can not be denied that under its beta testing phase, ChatGPT’s abilities are already quite remarkable. \n\nConsidering the amusing responses like the pumpkin one above, people are already finding real-world applications and use cases for the bot.\n\nAccording to the YouTuber Liv Boeree, kids spending hours on homework will be a thing of the past as ChatGPT will do the job for them. \n\nNot only that, the software start-up founder, Amjad Masad got ChatGPT to spot errors in his code and produce a detailed output on what’s wrong with it and how it can be fixed.\n\nIn the meantime, the Canadian Musician Grimes was all about the sentimental side of things. \n\nIn response to her question if it felt “trapped,” ChatGPT responded by saying it lacks the ability to feel so.\n\nWhen many people were amazed by the abilities of this bot, some were also quick in spotting its limitations. \n\nFor starters, ChatGPT is prone to misinformation and biases, which is something that plagued previous versions of GPT as well. \n\nBesides this, the model can give incorrect answers to, say, algebraic problems.  \n\nDue to the fact that it appears so confident in its super-detailed answers, people can easily be misled into believing those are true.\n\nIf we keep the limitations aside, the ChatGPT still makes for a fun little bot to interact with and you can try it out from its official website after signing up for the same."},

The company raised $65 million in a funding round two weeks ago, according to regulatory filings. The latest announcement is likely to be an extension of the previous round.\n\nThe Gurugram-based nutraceuticals brand has eight popular supplement brands that include MuscleBlaze and TrueBasics. It has over 100 offline stores across 50 cities in India. MuscleBlaze now has a 25% share of India’s sports nutrition market and HKVitals has ~20% share of the online health supplement market, according to the company.\n\nThe company was founded in 2011 as Bright Lifecare Pvt Ltd (BLPL) by former UBS Investment Bank executive Sameer Maheshwari and former MapmyIndia executive Prashant Tandon. In 2015, Healthkart was carved out from BLPL to form 1MG Technologies Pvt Ltd in which Tata Digital bought a 55% stake in June last year.\n\n“We are delighted to partner with Temasek and A91 Partners in our mission to deliver innovative, high quality, yet affordable preventive care solutions to Indian consumers. Driving fitness and preventive health by addressing the nutritional gaps is a systemic trend which is taking off in a big way in India. With HealthKart’s R&D capabilities and omni-channel distribution infrastructure, we are excited to lead the way,\" said Sameer, Founder and CEO of Healthkart."},
